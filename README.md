Google Colab repository 


I'm not sure how to create a good repository but I just updated to the latest work. 

For the limit function I was thinking of trying it out in pycharm before moving to google colab.

plt.scatter() is used to graph multiple points on a graph so it may be useful. 

I'll keep looking into it for now.
